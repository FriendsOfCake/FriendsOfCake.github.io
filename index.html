        <h3><a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome friend !</h3>
        <p><strong>Friends Of Cake</strong> is a group of passionate CakePHP developers, working together to improve the CakePHP community and produce high quality CakePHP plugins.</p>

        <h3><a name="community" class="anchor" href="#community"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Community</h3>
        <p>We want to help build an awesome CakePHP community. A community where people work together, unite their efforts, help each other out and be all-round friendly supportive chaps and chappesses.</p>
        <p>We want to create a community that helps promote and unite the CakePHP community, to everyone's benefit.</p>

        <h3><a name="plugins" class="anchor" href="#plugins"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plugins & Code</h3>
        <p>We want to create a "go to" place for high quality and well maintained CakePHP plugins.</p>
        <p>We aim to unite people around some central, common plugins. Rather than having several forks of a plugin, we want to merge them into one awesome plugin that everyone can contribute to.</p>

        <h3><a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>
        <p>
            Friends Of Cake currently works on these projects:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/crud">crud</a> - (formerly jippi/cakephp-crud) - Application development on steroids</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/app-template">app-template</a> - An empty 2.4 cakephp application template, for use with composer</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/builtwithcake">Built With Cake</a> - A website to showcase awesome CakePHP projects</a></li>
            </ul>
		Our intention is for all projects to be fresh and relevant - as such should any project become obsolete or lose interest from the community (idle for 6 months),
		it will be archivehd.</p>
